# BPPmulti
Perl script for running multiple iBPP and BPP instances

Automatically run iBPPv2.1.2 and BPPv3 multiple times
- with pairwise combinations of X tau and Y theta priors
- on multiple data sets (prior, molecular, trait, integrative)
- on multiple guide tree topologies
- in parallel


I will add the scirpt shortly
